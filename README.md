# 🗳️ Blockchain-Based E-Voting Electrol Integrity 

## 📘 Overview
- This research introduces a **secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving blockchain-based electronic voting (e-voting) system**.  
- The proposed framework supports **mixed voting formats** — including **approval voting** and **score voting** — to better represent real-world electoral preferences.  
- By integrating **advanced cryptography** (blind signatures, homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proofs) with **blockchain transparency**, the system ensures **anonymity**, **integrity**, and **verifiability** throughout the voting process.

## 🎯 Research Objectives
- Support **multiple ballot types** (approval and score) within a unified blockchain-based voting system.  
- Preserve **voter anonymity** and **ballot privacy** through **multi-authority blind signature schemes**.  
- Enable **secure and efficient tallying** using **homomorphic encryption** and **threshold decryption**.  
- Provide **public verifiability** via **zero-knowledge proofs** and **blockchain audit trails**.  
- Evaluate system performance on **large-scale synthetic datasets** simulating realistic election scenarios.
